## Dataset Overview

The dataset originates from athletes’ **daily martial arts training videos**, totaling **197 video clips**.
Each clip may consist of multiple merged segments. We apply **automatic temporal segmentation**, resulting in **1,726 sub-clips**, ensuring that most segments avoid abrupt transitions that could introduce excessive motion discontinuities.

All sub-clips are processed using **GVHMR** for motion capture, followed by **GMR-based reorientation**.
After filtering and post-processing, the final dataset contains **848 motion samples**, primarily reflecting routine training activities.

Due to substantial noise in the source videos, the dataset has undergone multiple rounds of manual screening and meticulous per-sample refinement. While minor imperfections may still remain in certain samples, we ensure that the vast majority satisfy the requirements for reliable motion tracking.

> **Project Status: Active Development with Ready Ground Subset**
> Model training is currently under active development.
> The **Ground** subset of the dataset is largely complete and ready for training.
> The **Jump** subset still has minor imperfections due to video source limitations. Most samples have been carefully screened, though training performance may vary.
> Your feedback and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

## 🤩 What’s New: Mjlab-Based Fall Recovery Code (Open Source)

This project is built upon the open-source **[unitree_rl_mjlab](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_rl_mjlab)** framework from Unitree Robotics. We have extended it with implementations of fall recovery and LKE sampling modules, and hereby publicly release the code repository related to 1307 motion training.

See the [Training with Unitree RL Mjlab](#code) section for detailed usage.

### Notes

* The dataset consists of **992 motion samples** in total, divided into **Ground (822)** and **Jump (170)** categories.
* **Daily Training** accounts for the largest proportion, with **624 samples** across both ground and jump motions, mainly reflecting basic routine movements.
* Ground motions include **Fist (93), Saber / Sword (99)**, and **Staff (80)**; jump motions include a small number of **Fist (5), Saber / Sword (12)**, and **Staff (10)** techniques.
* **Skill-based movements** only exist in jump motions, totaling **69 samples**, focusing on high-difficulty acrobatics such as **Side Flip (35), Air Spin (18), Lotus Swing (13)**, and **Backflip (3)**.
* Weapon-related motions only contain overall movement sequences and do not include detailed weapon or hand operations (to be updated in future versions).

## Motion Statistics Comparison

All metrics are averaged over the entire dataset.

| Dataset                    | Joint Vel. | Body Lin. Vel. | Body Ang. Vel. | Average Frames   |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| LAFAN1                     | 0.00142    | 0.00021        | 0.01147        | 10749.23 |
| PHUMA                      | 0.00120    | 0.00440        | -0.00131       | 169.59   |
| AMASS                      | 0.00048    | -0.00568       | 0.00903        | 370.65   |
| **KungFuAthlete (Ground)** | -0.00199   | 0.01057        | 0.04034        | 577.68   |
| **KungFuAthlete (Jump)**   | 0.02384    | 0.05297        | 0.18017        | 397.21   |

## Ground vs. Jump Subsets

We divide the dataset based on the presence of jumping motions:

* **KungFuAthlete (Ground)**
  Contains non-jumping actions, emphasizing:

  * Continuous ground-based power generation
  * Rapid body rotations
  * Weapon manipulation and stance transitions

* **KungFuAthlete (Jump)**
  Includes high-dynamic aerial motions such as:

  * Somersaults
  * Cartwheels
  * Other acrobatic jumps

### Key Observations

* The **Jump subset** exhibits the **highest joint velocity, body linear velocity, and angular velocity** among all compared datasets.
* The **Ground subset**, while excluding jumps, still shows significantly higher dynamics than natural motion datasets (e.g., LAFAN1, AMASS).
* Compared to PHUMA and AMASS, which focus on daily activities and walking motions, **KungFuAthlete demonstrates stronger non-stationarity, larger motion amplitudes, and more challenging transient dynamics**, even at comparable or higher frame rates.

### ⚠️ Safety Warning

> The *Jump* subset is intended for studying the upper limits of humanoid motion. Direct training or deployment on real robots without strict safety constraints may lead to serious hardware damage.

## Data Format

### GVHMR pred

```python
# gvhmr_pred.pt
{
  "smpl_params_global":
  {
    "body_pose": torch.Tensor,    # (N, 63)
    "betas": torch.Tensor,    # (N, 10)
    "global_orient": torch.Tensor,    # (N, 3)
    "transl": torch.Tensor,    # (N, 3)
  }
  "smpl_params_incam":
  ...
}
```

If you intend to perform motion retargeting to other robotic platforms, or to employ alternative retargeting methodologies, please use the SMPL-H files provided in the  `collection_gvhmr` directory.

### GMR qpos (`org_smoothed/`)

```python
# robot_qpos.npz
{
  "fps": array(30),
  "qpos": np.ndarray,    # (N, 36) 36 = 3(position xyz) + 4(quaternion wxyz) + 29(DOF)
}
```


### For BeyondMimic (`org_smoothed_mj/`)

All motion files under `org_smoothed_mj/` are stored in NumPy `.npz` format and contain time-sequential kinematic data for Unitree G1 training. Each file represents a single motion clip sampled at `fps` Hz and includes joint-level states and rigid-body states expressed in the **world coordinate frame** (quaternion format: xyzw; units: meters, radians, m/s, rad/s).

```python
motion_clip = {
    "fps": np.array([50]),               # Frame rate (Hz)
    "joint_pos": np.ndarray,             # Shape (T, 36), joint DoF positions (rad)
    "joint_vel": np.ndarray,             # Shape (T, 35), joint angular velocities (rad/s)
    "body_pos_w": np.ndarray,            # Shape (T, 53, 3), rigid body positions in world frame (m)
    "body_quat_w": np.ndarray,           # Shape (T, 53, 4), rigid body orientations in world frame (xyzw)
    "body_lin_vel_w": np.ndarray,        # Shape (T, 53, 3), rigid body linear velocities (m/s)
    "body_ang_vel_w": np.ndarray,        # Shape (T, 53, 3), rigid body angular velocities (rad/s)
    "joint_names": np.ndarray,           # Shape (29,), controllable joint names (ordered)
    "body_names": np.ndarray,            # Shape (53,), rigid body names (ordered, includes head_link)
}
```

Here, `T` denotes the number of frames in the motion clip.

## Download Dataset

You can obtain the KungfuAthlete dataset through **[this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZntW9jPA-BXxttvCWlKQsSbmXt91fSsh?usp=sharing)** and use it directly for your robot training. We provide GVHMR pred data and pre-cleaned **g1** robot qpos data. 

The KungfuAthlete dataset is constructed from publicly available high-dynamic videos on the , which undergo GVHMR action extraction, GMR retargeting, and data cleaning. The KungfuAthlete dataset is divided into two types: **Ground** and **Jump**. Ground indicates that there will always be one foot on the ground during the entire motion, while Jump indicates that both feet are off the ground during motion. 

The following content includes visualizations of GVHMR and GMR data, as well as examples of how we use height adjustment algorithms to process the qpos data. If you wish to apply this dataset to other robots, you can refer to our processing pipeline.

## Training with Unitree RL Mjlab (BeyondMimic-style) <a id="code"></a>

### 1. Installation

Use the following command to create a virtual environment:

```bash
conda create -n unitree_rl_mjlab python=3.11
conda activate unitree_rl_mjlab
sudo apt install -y libyaml-cpp-dev libboost-all-dev libeigen3-dev libspdlog-dev libfmt-dev
cd unitree_rl_mjlab
pip install -e .
```

If you encounter any issues during installation, please refer to [the installation documentation for Unitree RL Mjlab](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_rl_mjlab/blob/main/doc/setup_en.md).

### 2. Prepare Motion Files

We provide a **ready-to-use** 1307 motion file for direct training.

To use other motions, run the commands below to convert qpos files in the `org_smoothed/` directory to NPZ training files.

```bash
python scripts/qpos_to_npz.py \
--input-file org_smooth/ground_smoothed/1307/1307.npz \
--output-name 1307.npz \
```

### 3. Training

After confirming the NPZ file are prepared, you can launch training. For detailed training parameters, please refer to [Unitree RL Mjlab](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_rl_mjlab/blob/main/README.md#22-training).

Our training is divided into **three stages**:
- Stage 1: Enable the policy to roughly track motions and acquire basic fall recovery capabilities.
  ```bash
  python scripts/train.py Unitree-G1-1307-Stage-I --motion_file=src/assets/motions/g1/1307.npz --env.scene.num-envs=8192 --env.commands.motion.sampling-mode=adaptive
  ```
- Stage 2: Improve the precision of motion tracking for the policy.
  ```bash
  python scripts/train.py Unitree-G1-1307-Stage-II --motion_file=src/assets/motions/g1/1307.npz --env.scene.num-envs=8192 --env.commands.motion.sampling-mode=adaptive --agent.resume=True
  ```
- Stage 3: Enhance the robustness of the policy to reduce the likelihood of falling.
  ```bash
  python scripts/train.py Unitree-G1-1307-Stage-III --motion_file=src/assets/motions/g1/1307.npz --env.scene.num-envs=8192 --env.commands.motion.sampling-mode=adaptive --agent.resume=True
  ```

### Released Models

Model Path: `unitree_rl_mjlab\models\`

* **1307** — Tai Chi sequence (~5 minutes continuous motion)

#### ⚠️ Safety Notice

> ⚠️ **Deployment to physical hardware involves inherent risks.**
> Although these policies demonstrate fall-resilient behavior in simulation, real-world execution may lead to unexpected dynamics, instability, or hardware stress.
> Users are strongly advised to conduct careful validation in simulation before deploying to real robots. We assume no responsibility for any potential hardware damage resulting from improper use or deployment.

### Inference

To visualize policy behavior in MuJoCo:

```bash
python scripts/play.py Unitree-G1-1307-Stage-I --motion_file=src/assets/motions/g1/1307.npz --checkpoint_file=models/1307/1307.pt
```

### Real and Simulation Deployment (Same to Unitree RL Mjlab)

You can use the motion file 1307.npz, together with the policy files policy.onnx and policy.onnx.data, for both real and simulation deployment.

For detailed deployment instructions and code, please refer to [Unitree RL Mjlab](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_rl_mjlab/blob/main/README.md#4-real-deployment).

## For Data Adjustment

We have included a video (.mp4) for each action dataset in the download link. If you wish to utilize the root node adjustment feature or visualize the data yourself, please navigate to the `retarget/` directory and install the third-party packages listed below the repository:

### 1. GMR Environment (Robot Retargeting)

```bash
conda create -n gmr python=3.10 -y
conda activate gmr
cd third_party/GMR
pip install -e .
cd ./..
```

### 2. Vis-GVHMR Environment (Pose Visualization)

```bash
conda create -n vis-gvhmr python=3.9 -y
conda activate vis-gvhmr
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add new GMR scripts

To use GMR-retargeted data for training, we have added scripts to GMR that adapt the data to training program required qpos format.

```bash
cp ./scripts/gvhmr_to_qpos.py ./third_party/GMR/scripts/
cp ./scripts/vis_robot_qpos.py ./third_party/GMR/scripts/
cp ./scripts/adjust_robot_height_by_gravity.py ./third_party/GMR/scripts/
```
## Usage

> **Note**: Our **height adjustment algorithm** only applies to **qpos data** that is retargeted to **jump** type data, and **ground** type data does not require height adjustment after retargeting.

> **Note**: The GVHMR visualization script and the GMR project rely on different environments. Please ensure that you are in the correct file directory and conda environment (`gmr` or `vis-gvhmr`) when executing different tasks.

```

## The Height-Adjusted Examples
When predicting jump-type actions or data with excessive leg movement variations, the root node of GVHMR often exhibits height drift over time. We propose an extreme point correction method to adjust the root node height.

* [Unitree RL Mjlab](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_rl_mjlab): A lightweight, modular framework for RL robotics research and sim-to-real deployment.

We gratefully acknowledge these projects, upon which this dataset and training pipeline are built. GVHMR recovers 3D human motion directly in a gravity-aligned reference frame, enabling physically consistent motion reconstruction from raw training videos. GMR is used for motion reorientation and normalization. Unitree RL Mjlab is a comprehensive humanoid robotics framework for training and deploying reinforcement learning policies on humanoid robots. Without these open-source projects, large-scale processing of in-the-wild martial arts videos and the open release of this dataset would not have been feasible.
